This library adds a simple hook into Django's ``manage.py`` to be able to start gevent's WSGI
server to serve the Django project.

**NOTE**: Only Django<1.7 is currently supported.

Install
-------

Install the library into your Python installation via ``pip``::

    pip install django-gevent-deploy

Then add the library into ``INSTALLED_APPS`` within Django's project ``settings.py``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_gevent_deploy',
    )

Configuration
-------------

You may add two settings to your ``settings.py``:

``GEVENT_ADDR_PORT``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifies what address and what port should be used for the gevent's WSGI server.
Must be a **string** and of the ``[[addr:]port]`` format::

    '8000'            # default
    'localhost:8000'
    '127.0.0.1:8000'

``GEVENT_POOL_SIZE``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifies the number of greenlets gevent can spawn for the server. Can be ``None``
or an integer value::

    None              # default
    1
    100

Usage
-----

To start the gevent's WSGI server, simply call ``rungevent`` in ``manage.py``. The command
accepts optional argumets which are the same as described in `Configuration`_ section.
If the arguments are not provided, then the configuration from the ``settings.py`` is used,
or default if ``settings.py`` is not configured::

    $ python manage.py rungevent [[addr]:port] [pool_size]
